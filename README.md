# WayshrineTabSelector
Addon for Elder Scrolls Online - let you choose the default tab in wayshrine menus.


Description:

It annoys me to click every time when I am questing on the quest tab when I visit a wayshrine,
so I have developed this tiny addon:
With these you could change the default tab of the wayshrine menu. 
Just open the Addon settings and choose your favourite tab in the dropdown list :)

Dependencies:
  - LibAddonMenu-2.0
